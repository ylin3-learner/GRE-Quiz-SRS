# GRE Quiz SRS

For ‰∏≠Êñá, see [README.md](README.md)

### Project Motivation
Memorizing GRE vocabulary is painful, so I decided to create a handy tool to make it easier.  
- SM2 manages memory efficiency  
- AIMD prevents drowning in the sea of vocabulary  

No significant progress in memorization, but procrastination reached professional levels.  

A farewell gift to my past self who suffered through vocabulary memorization ‚Äî  

And to all fellow English majors struggling in the sea of words.

> A farewell gift to my fellow English majors, from someone who escaped to CS but never forgot the pain.

## Project Overview

This project is an **adaptive spaced repetition system (SRS)** for GRE vocabulary and roots, combining:

- **Three-stage learning strategy:** Blind Test ‚Üí AIMD workload control ‚Üí SM-2 algorithm  
- **AIMD workload control** (Additive Increase / Multiplicative Decrease) dynamically adjusts the daily practice quota  
- **SM-2 scheduling algorithm:** calculates the next review time based on answer quality  
- **Intense mode:** temporarily lifts daily quota restrictions  
- **Real-time terminal workload visualization:** progress bars displaying learning load status  
- **Multi-field question bank support:** roots, vocabulary, example sentences, and translations  

> **In brief:**  
> SM-2 handles the optimal intervals for flashcard reviews,  
> AIMD regulates the overall daily learning workload,  
> Together they prevent brain burnout while ensuring sufficient practice.

## System Architecture and Design Philosophy

![System Architecture](doc/system-architecture.png)

> SM-2 and AIMD form a feedback loop, dynamically adjusting review schedules and workload based on your performance. (Illustration)

## AIMD Workload Trend (Conceptual Illustration)

![Conceptual AIMD Trend](doc/aimd-trend.png)

> Additive Increase gradually raises study load,  
> Multiplicative Decrease rapidly lowers it when stress is high,  
> Ensuring mental health and learning efficiency go hand in hand.

## Question Bank Format and User Profile

* **Core is a CLI (Command Line Interface) version:** lightweight, easily extendable, suitable for automation and advanced users.
* **Primary users are mostly non-technical (non-CS) background:** unfamiliar with JSON/CSV and command line operations.
* Therefore, an **Excel format question bank (`voc.xlsx`)** is provided, allowing you to edit words and example sentences directly with a familiar interface, zero programming needed.

**Friendly Reminder:**
Please **back up your `voc.xlsx` regularly** to avoid accidental data loss.

Additionally, we offer a **GUI version** on the [Releases page](https://github.com/ylin3-learner/GRE-Quiz-SRS/releases), fully compatible with `voc.xlsx` and featuring automatic backup of question banks, providing the friendliest experience for those uncomfortable with command line.

## Usage

Start the program:

```bash
python quiz.py
```

Menu:

* `1` Root mode
* `2` Vocabulary mode
* `3` View statistics
* `4` Toggle intense mode
* `q` Quit and save

**Notes:**

* Each question has a time limit; timeout counts as incorrect
* The system automatically calculates review intervals and saves progress
* Progress is saved in `voc.xlsx`; please back up regularly
